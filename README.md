# RegenX Game Engine

After being intimidated by the scale of a game engine project for a long time, I decided to give it a blind shot. This is **RegenX**, my second attempt at building a game engine from scratch. This project is in no way perfect. In fact, it is likely one of the most flawed codebases you’ll ever see if you know how coding works. My goal is to learn, experiment, and have fun, so don’t take the messy code to heart.

This repository is primarily for documentation and personal reference. It is not intended for others to compile or use. I don’t plan to include build instructions here. If you want to figure out how to compile it, you are welcome to, or you can contact me and ask, but for now there won’t be any official building instructions unless I decide to add them.

## Features (Work in Progress)

* 2D and 3D rendering
* Modular architecture for easy expansion
* Planned editor integration (Qt, not yet public)

## Goals

* Understand the inner workings of a game engine
* Experiment with rendering pipelines and low-level systems
* Practice C++ and close-to-hardware programming concepts
* Develop a functional engine framework

## What I Aim to Do with This Project

In this project, I aim to learn and get hands-on experience with the following libraries and systems: OpenGL, OpenAL, ENet, Qt, CURL, and GLFW.

The project is a blind run. I deliberately haven’t read tutorials or guides yet. My goal is to learn by doing, to explore how far I can push myself, and to experience firsthand the challenges of integrating multiple systems in C++. This includes understanding compilation issues, linking dependencies, and managing modular code.

Additionally, this project is about experimentation. I want to see what happens when I try different approaches without preconceptions, to make mistakes, break things, and learn from them. If my experiments make the codebase unusable or chaotic, I will simply restart or refactor. This process is intended to give me practical experience and to teach me lessons that no tutorial could convey fully.
